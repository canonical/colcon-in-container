## Contributing code

The workflow for contributing code is as follows:

   want to work on a new feature, create an issue first! This gives everyone a place to discuss scope and implementation.
2. **Create a fork of the colcon-in-container repo**
3. **Make a new branch for your contribution**. Write your code there.
4. For details on how to **build and test colcon-in-container**, see the [README.md](./README.md). Add new tests as needed,
   and make sure the existing tests continue to pass when your changes are complete.
5. **Submit a pull request** to get changes from your branch into master. You can add "#Fixes xxx" where `xxx` is the issue number to 
   automatically link to the issue you chose or created earlier.
6. Someone will review your PR and may make suggestions or have comments, so **keep an eye on the PR status** in case there are changes to make
7. **Please make sure you have submitted your [CLA form](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors/agreement) if you are a first time contributor**.
